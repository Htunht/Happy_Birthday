        Happy 21st birthday babe.This is your third birthday that we've celebrated together and I hope to celebrate together another year,another year after it,for the rest of your life.Meeting you was truly one of the best thing to ever happen to me and I wish to meet you in every other lifetimes too.I wish you achieve your every goal in life,anything you doubt you'll achieve and I'll be there to support every bit of it.
        We've shared happy,sad,embarassing,cringe,painful,every kind of moments together and have seen every possible versions of each other and I wouldn't want it any other way.I cherish every moment we spend together and will try to make you happy for all the moments yet to come.I love you so much.
